# National Central University Bike Rental System

## Project Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive bike rental system, integrating the currently independent Youbike and oloo systems within the campus. These systems are not interoperable, and their interfaces are inconsistent. Our system will allow users to view the location and available quantity of both bicycles and electric scooters in one unified interface, thus providing a more convenient and standardized rental experience.


## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Django
- **Technologies**: Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax

## System Features
- **Integration of Mobility Tools**: This system integrates campus bicycles and electric vehicles into a single platform.
- **Consistent User Interface**: Users can check the location and available quantity of different types of mobility vehicles through a unified interface, ensuring consistency and convenience in operation.
